# Git Commit Message Rule
After performing the **`git add .`** command, the **`git commit`** message should follow this structure:

    git commit -m "[folder/file updated] - [task description]"

**Example:**
    
    git commit -m "Fashion_MNIST_Classifier/ItemClassification.ipynb - Reducing dimensions using PCA."

Task description should provide enough information for other members to understand what was updated or changed, e.g., fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring code.

After that, use the **`git push`** command to push into the GitHub repository.
